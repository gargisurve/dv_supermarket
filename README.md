INTRODUCTION:
In today's retail industry, data-driven insights are paramount for supermarkets to thrive and excel. This data visualization project delves deep into the realm of supermarket sales, where each transaction is a treasure trove of information about consumer preferences, purchasing habits, and more.


DATASET OVERVIEW:
The dataset comprises a comprehensive collection of attributes that capture the essence of supermarket sales, ranging from customer demographics to product details. These attributes include branch identifiers, city locations, customer types, gender distributions, product categories, unit prices, quantities purchased, total sales amounts, payment methods, and customer ratings.

Throughout this project, we employ various data visualization techniques to uncover hidden trends, relationships, and anomalies within the data. Our analytical journey is divided into 3 types-  univariate analysis, bivariate analysis and multivariate analysis.

Along this journey, we employ an arsenal of graphical representations to breathe life into our analysis:
Box Plots: Unveiling outliers and depicting data spread.
Histograms: Painting vivid frequency distributions.
Pie Charts: Showcasing categorical proportions.
Bar Charts: Facilitating comparisons of different factors.
Scatter Plots: Guiding us through correlations and dependencies.
Violin Plots: Offering detailed insights into variable distributions.
Heatmaps: Illuminating intricate correlations between attributes.
